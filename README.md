# Module 1: Data Wrangling with Python
## Sprint 4: Capstone Project

### About this Sprint

It is time for your first Capstone Project. You will work on this project for the whole Sprint.

We are glad you have successfully reached the final Sprint of this Module. You will put everything you have learned in this Module to work. The outcome of this Module should potentially serve as your portfolio item.

Unlike with previous projects, this time, you are free to choose a dataset to explore from three suggested ones. As you will have to solve a provided problem, there will not be a list of predefined questions you have to answer - be creative and explore any data dimensions you deem worth analyzing.

Although this might seem scary, this is how data science looks like in the industry. Often, it's your responsibility to not only give answers using the data but to raise questions first. The more creatively you look at this project, the better. Good luck!

### Objectives for this Part

- Practice identifying opportunities for data analysis.
- Practice performing EDA.
- Practice working with data from Kaggle.
- Practice visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Practice reading data, performing queries, and filtering data using Pandas.

### Problems

Choose one of the three provided problems. The outcomes are usually better if the problem that you are working on is interesting for you. This way you will come up with more ideas, what can be explored and analyzed.

#### COVID-19 crisis

The world is still struggling with one of the most rapidly spreading pandemics. There are a lot of people who say that data is the best weapon we can use in this "Corona Fight."

Imagine that you are one of the best data scientists in your country. The president of your country asked you to analyze the COVID-19 patient-level data of South Korea and prepare your homeland for the next wave of the pandemic. You, as the lead data scientist of your country have to create and prove a plan of fighting the pandemics in your country by analyzing the provided data. You must get the most critical insights using learned data science techniques and present them to the lead of your country.
